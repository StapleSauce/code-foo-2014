Its Pac-Man with wall jumping!

My favourite games have always been platformers, so I decided to incorporate the mechanics that I love in this project.

> **Featuring**

> - **Whac-Man** - the hungry hero who was built to jump off walls and eat pellets.

> - **Loopy** - the pink ghost who likes to patrol the perimeter of the map. His movements may be predictable, but he can be dangerous when trying to navigate to the top of the map.
 
> - **Screwy** - the blue ghost who has no sense of direction, he's constantly getting lost in the maze and he may just run into you.

> - and **Chase** - the orange ghost who is incredible clingy, it's as if he knows your position at all times. 

> - **Customizable Map** - by editing map.txt in Assets/Map you, *yes YOU*, can make your own map. Boundaries should remain the same, and keep in mind the ghost's movement patterns for best results.

The controls can be customized when the game starts.

If your game ends you can restart by pressing the `Enter` key.
